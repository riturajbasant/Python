        ### DxOpenClient Implementation using PyXB ###
        
        This branch is for DxOpenClient Implementation using PyXB. 
        
        This is done as an attempt to make DxOpen Python implementation operational for version 2.x
        General thought is 2.7+ (since 2.7 is currently most stable, at the time of writing this text.)
        This is being done using PyXB package which converts entities in .xsd to python objects.
        
        generateDS also does the same but post conversion, had to move to Python 3.7 necessarily.
        
        Hence this branch has been cut to attempt backward compatibility for end users currently operating on
        Python 2.x
        
        Some other notes:
            1.
            generateDS conversion footprint is considreably less than PyXB's.
            genDS Dxopen schema FP: somewhat 4 MB.
            PyXB  Dxopen schema FP: somewhat 13-14 MB.
        
            2.
            genDS conversion is somewhat cleaner and easy to read as compare to PyXB's.
